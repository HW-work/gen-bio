Takeaways from VAE tutorial
1. The generative model is able to capture the dependencies betweed dimensions. 
Latent Variable Models: We have a vector of latent variables z in a high-dimensional space Z which we can easily sample according to some probability density function (PDF) p(z) defined over Z.  
Say we have a family of deterministic functions f(z;&theta;), parameterized by a vector &theta; in some space &Theta;, 
where f: Z &times; &Theta; &rightarrow; X
